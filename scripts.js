const cities = ["Oakland", "New York"];


// How would you dynamically add Memphis to the array of cities?


//How would you dynamically add Atlanta and Denver to the array of cities at the same time?

// Log the final array to the console. 


/********************** Exercise 8 **********************/

const cityString = "Detroit,Atlanta,Birmingham,New Haven,Dallas,San Diego,Portland";

// Now let's split the array at each comma. How would you create an array with each of the cities as a separate value?


// What is the length of the new array?


// Log the array to the console


// How would you log the last city in the array to the console?


// Using the .join() method, how would you turn the list of cities back into a string with spaces after the commas?


/********************** Exercise 9 **********************/


let myString = 'Ryu+Ken+Chun-Li+Cammy+Guile+Sakura+Sagat+Juri';

// Convert the string into an array, removing the + characters in the process. Save the result in a variable called myArray.


// Store the length of the array in a variable called arrayLength.


// Store the last item in the array in a variable called lastItem.


// Remove the last item in the array.
