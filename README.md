# Working with Arrays

- An array is a special data type that allows you to store and organize multiple values, such as numbers, strings, or other objects, in a single variable. Arrays are used to create lists, collections, and data structures that can be easily added to and iterated over.

- An array in JavaScript is an ordered collection of elements, where each element has a numeric index (starting from 0) that represents its position in the array. The first element is at index 0, the second element is at index 1, and so on. Arrays can contain elements of different data types, and they can dynamically change in size.

### Array Methods

- In JavaScript, array methods are built-in functions that can be called on arrays to perform various operations on their elements. These methods allow you to change, search, iterate, and perform other actions on the elements of an array conveniently and efficiently.
